# TensorFlow ResNet Implementation

This is a TensorFlow implementation of a ResNet CNN for image recognition and classification. 
I have adapted it from the v2 Keras implementation at: https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_resnet/

## Model Depth
Depth of the ResNet v2 can be defined by modifying the 'n' variable in code which corresponds to the particular model as shown in the following table:

Model           n
ResNet20 v2 	  2
ResNet32 v2 	  N/A
ResNet44 v2 	  N/A
ResNet56 v2 	  6
ResNet110 v2 	  12
ResNet164 v2 	  18
ResNet1001 v2 	111
