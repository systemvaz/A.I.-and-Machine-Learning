# TensorFlow ResNet Implementation

This is a TensorFlow implementation of a ResNet CNN for image recognition and classification. 
I have adapted it from the v2 Keras implementation at: https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_resnet/

## Model Depth
Depth of the ResNet v2 can be defined by modifying the 'n' variable in code which corresponds to the particular model as shown in the following list:

* ResNet20 v2 	  **(n=2)**
* ResNet56 v2 	  **(n=6)**
* ResNet110 v2 	  **(n=12)**
* ResNet164 v2 	  **(n=18)**
* ResNet1001 v2 	**(n=111)**
